gittalife
=========

Wordpress site for GittaLife.

**backups** includes a backup of the original site and periodic DB backups of the new site.

**images** contains images used on the site. These are kept separate to the Wordpress install under <code>public&#95;html</code> as Wordpress does some scaling and so on. 

**public&#95;html** contains the Wordpress install, <code>.htaccess</code> and the <code>robots.txt</code> file.

**email-tests.txt** is just a bunch of tests to test the email forwarders setup on the site.
